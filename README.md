# Information-Theory-Finance
The goal of this project is to apply information theory to financial time series. In summary, the goal is to:

1. Analyse the efficacy of commonly used time series features (e.g. moving averages, Kalman filters, RSI, MACD, etc.)
2. Perform representation learning for financial time series using mutual information as a loss function

The research question is: do commonly used features provide any meaningful information, and if so, can deep learning be used to generate better features?
